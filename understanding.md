what are the tsteps of the cli tool


First you call the cli witht he test command -> usnig the path to the "tests" it calls `ParseFolder`

ParseFolder reads all thef iels in the directory, and it identifies the tests by fidning files that end in `.json`

IF THEY ARE JSON FILES:
it then applies `ParseTest` to them. It logs out that it found a test and adds them to a slice of Tests

ParseTest seems ot simply read the json file, and umarshal it. Once it does this it populatest the 
test.FileContent with the result of `ReadContents` and test.SourceFIle with the filepath. Finally it returns the Test object.
> [!NOTE]
> I belive here that usign the Metadata flags form the Test object, it is able to populat the different attributes from the json

ReadContents simply read the file, converts everythign to string and applies a TrimSpace

we now exit Parse Folder and go into `RunTests`

RunTests ercevies a mode, which by default is a string `local`. and It recevies the slice of Test objects
generated by the parse

## RunTests 
creates a BQ server and sets it up with the project ID and dataset needed

It then sets the project (Aagain? it seems)

Then creates a testServer from that bq server object fist crerated

We then create a bigquery client and set the properties for it

it then defines a lastErr object that seems to be used for loggin later on 

Now it simply loops through all the tests in the Test object slice - for each:
it logs that it is runnig the test 

It runs `GenerateTestSQL` on the test object:
this ahs three steps:
it creates a queryWithMockedData object, by calling the `sql` function
the `sql` function:
